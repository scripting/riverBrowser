# riverBrowser

riverBrowser is a JavaScript toolkit that displays a <a href="http://scripting.com/2014/06/02/whatIsARiverOfNewsAggregator.html">river of news</a>.

Here's a <a href="http://scripting.com/2015/06/19/riverbrowserOpenSourceRelease.html">blog post</a> announcing this project.

#### What is a river?

A river is a reverse-chronologic list of new stories. 

<a href="https://github.com/scripting/river5">River5</a> is a Node.js app that generates these files. 

It's an open, <a href="http://riverjs.org/">documented</a> format, available for anyone to use.

#### Demo app

Here's the <a href="http://fargo.io/code/browsers/riverbrowserdemo.html">demo app</a> for riverBrowser.

I took a snapshot of one of my rivers, so the content would stay fixed. It can be difficult to discuss rivers because they're always changing. The content in this river won't change. 

The <a href="https://github.com/scripting/riverBrowser/blob/master/riverbrowserdemo.html">source</a> for the demo app is included in this repository.

#### httpGetRiver

To load a river from the web, call httpGetRiver.

<code>httpGetRiver ("http://fargo.io/code/browsers/frozenriver.js", "idRiverDisplay");</code>

The first parameter is the address of the river file. The second parameter is the id of a div, which is where you want the river to be displayed. From there everything is handled for you.
